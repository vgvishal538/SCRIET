    <string name="hello_world" translatable="false">Sir Chhotu Ram Institute of Engineering &amp; Technology
        was established in 2002 with the aim of providing quality education in the field of Engineering and Technology.
        The Institute is a constituent part of the Ch. Charan Singh University, Meerut. The Institute started functioning
        with the admission of students in the B.Tech. courses in seven branches : Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering,
        Mechanical Engineering, Agricuture Engineering, and Computer Sciences , Information Technology,Chemical Engg,
        Electronics &amp; Instrumentation. From the academic session 2004 one more B.Tech. branch Electronics &amp; Instrumentation
        Engineering added to the academic programme of the Institute. In July 2005, a new brach Information Technology was
        introduced by fabricating the branch Computer Science &amp; information technology.From academic session 2011-2012,the
        institute has also been entrusted to run M.C.A. programme which was being conducated in the University from 2004.
        Engineering education &amp; research is ever demanding field of study since the oldest civilization.industrial deveof
        nations was made possible by the movement of wheel,but search is on to improve the efficiency is wheel.We have reached
        from 8% to 40% and the search for still higher efficiency is more vigorously pursued today.The role of engineer is
        not confined to industries, service centers or workshops but has gone beyond.The half-life period of engineering
        education has been greatly reduced due to explosion of knowledge and computer database created by R &amp; D.
        There is an urgent need to keep pace with the development by re-engineering with the course curriculum.
        Besides seven Engineering Departments Computer Science Engineering, Information Technology, Electronics &amp; Communication,
        Electronice &amp; Instrumentation, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Agriculture Engineering and a
        Division of Applied Science is also been here.</string>
